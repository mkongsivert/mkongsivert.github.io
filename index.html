											<div class="content">
												<h3>Understanding social welfare loss in homogeneous vs. heterogeneous dynamic matching markets</h3>
												<p>In this project, we implement a simple model of a dynamic matching market, extending the simple greedy model to one that may alternate strategies at any time. We then analyze the results and propose extensions for more realistic settings.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>MAGE-SELECT: scRNA-seq marker gene selection as a multi-Level Bayesian logistic regression problem</h3>
												<p>MAGE-SELECT is an approach to identifying "marker" genes (which distinguish cell types from each other) by grouping them using multi-level Bayesian logistic regression. We also show in this document that it is both efficient and more accurate than several alternative strategies.</p>

												<h3>Quantum Complexity: An Overview of QMA</h3>
												<p>This document seeks to explain the quantum complexity class QMA---which is somewhat analogous to the classical complexity class P---and its variant QMA(2).</p>

												<h3>User-Side Detection of Evil-Twin Attacks</h3>
												<p>This is a user study that seeks to measure susceptibility to evil-twin attacks on public networks. It also proposes a few user-side defenses and tests users' responsiveness to them.</p>

												<h3>Detecting Environmental Hazards in Historical Maps</h3>
												<p>For my undergraduate capstone project, I worked with a team to develop an image processing and OCR pipeline for extracting and interpreting land-use data from historical maps. (There is also a poster for this project <a href="pdfs/clinic-poster.pdf" target="_none">here</a>.)</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>An Investigation of Monotone Properties of Graphs</h3>
												<p>The focus of this paper was to explain monotone properties of graphs to an audience with some mathematical background but limited knowledge of graph theory. We also discuss the connection of these monotone properties to evasiveness and testability, and we go on to discuss a few open problems in this area.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>Modeling Large-Scale Adoption of Electric Vehicles</h3>
												<p>This was our (Authors: Marina Knittel, Mackenzie Kong-Sivert, and Nelll White) submission to the 2018 Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling. In it, we describe a flexible and efficient agent-based model of large-scale adoption of electric vehicles in response to different placements of charging stations.</p>

												<h3>Highway Efficiency Gains From Self Driving Cars</h3>
												<p>This was our (Authors: Mackenzie Kong-Sivert, Caitlin Lienkaemper, and Micah Pedrick) submission to the 2017 Mathematical Contest in Modeling. In it, we describe a finite automaton model of self-driving cars in highway traffic. This paper earned us the distintion of "Meritorious Winner", which means that we were in the top 7% of submissions.</p>

												<h3>Improvising With Neural Networks: What We Did</h3>
												<p>This paper explains the contributions that my team made to the ImproVisor Project in 2016. Specifically, it explains the previous state of the project; the different machine learning methods we tried (LSTM networks, GANs, and autoencoders); and our results.</p>
